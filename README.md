# P2P - CHAT APP REACT APP using HOLEPUNCHüíªü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

P2P Chat App is a lightweight, easy-to-use React app that allows you to chat with friends and family in real time. With This app, you can create a private chat room or join an existing one, send text messages, photos, and videos, and even make voice calls.üì≤

This app is built using the Holepunch platform, which is a secure, reliable, and scalable platform for building P2P chat apps. This app is easy to use, even for users with no prior experience with React apps.üìûüì±

### Why do we need a relay?


A relay in P2P apps is a server that sits between two users and relays messages between them. This is necessary for a number of reasons, including:

- Security: A relay can help to protect the privacy of users by encrypting messages before they are sent. This prevents third parties from eavesdropping on the conversation.
- Scalability: A relay can help to scale P2P apps by distributing the load of messages across multiple servers. This can prevent individual servers from becoming overloaded.
- Reliability: A relay can help to improve the reliability of P2P apps by providing a backup path for messages. If one server goes down, the relay can still relay messages between the two users.

In some cases, a relay may not be necessary. For example, if two users are on the same network, they can communicate directly with each other without a relay. However, in most cases, a relay is a valuable addition to a P2P app.

Here are some additional benefits of using a relay in P2P apps:

- Firewall traversal: A relay can help users to bypass firewalls that may block direct P2P connections.
- NAT traversal: A relay can help users to connect to each other even if they are behind NAT routers.
- Bandwidth sharing: A relay can help to share bandwidth between users, which can improve performance for everyone.

Overall, a relay can be a valuable addition to any P2P app. It can help to improve security, scalability, reliability, firewall traversal, NAT traversal, and bandwidth sharing.

### Implementation

- 1. Create a DHT instance.

```
import b4a from 'b4a'
import DHT from '@hyperswarm/dht-relay'
import Stream from '@hyperswarm/dht-relay/ws'

const ws = new WebSocket('wss://dht2-relay.leet.ar')
const dht = new DHT(new Stream(true, ws))
```

Now we are using dht2-relay.leet.ar as a relay, which is not P2P, (this is a limitation from browsers.)

- 2. Create Hyperswarm

```
import Hyperswarm from 'hyperswarm'

// DHT ...

const swarm = new Hyperswarm({ dht }) // you pass it as an option
```

- 3. Handling method Swarm connection

```
swarm.on('connection', function (socket, info) {
  console.log('new swarm connection')

  socket.on("data", function (data) {
    console.log("data", data);
    addToHistory({ from: socket, message: b4a.toString(data) });
  });
})
```

- 4. Join swarm
```
const topic = b4a.alloc(32).fill("game-room-002"); // + custom room name, prefix + hash it
swarm.join(topic);
```
